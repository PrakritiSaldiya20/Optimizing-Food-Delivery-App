# Optimizing Food Delivery App ðŸššðŸ“¦

This project focuses on optimizing a food delivery application by predicting order demand and optimizing delivery routes using machine learning and time series forecasting techniques.

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
Efficient delivery logistics are crucial for food delivery platforms. This project uses real-world data including order history, weather conditions, and peak hours to build predictive models that help:

- Forecast order volumes
- Optimize delivery resource allocation
- Improve delivery time predictions

## ðŸ”§ Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- Statsmodels (SARIMAX)
- TensorFlow/Keras (LSTM)
- Jupyter Notebooks

## ðŸ“ˆ Key Features
- **Time Series Forecasting** using SARIMAX and LSTM to predict future order demand
- **Feature Engineering** based on weather, peak hours, and regional data
- **Delivery Optimization** through route and resource planning based on predicted demand
- **Visualizations** to monitor trends, prediction accuracy, and performance metrics

## ðŸ“Š Results
- Improved delivery time prediction accuracy by X%
- Enhanced efficiency in driver allocation and route planning
